Master program: 1 raspberry pi as acess point, running web server probably implemented with NodeJS? nginx? apache?, cameras connected

Scenario 1: Take picture
1. Get a signal from the web api when someone presses the button "Take picture"
2. Send a "1" on a GPIO-pin to all the slaves so that every camera takes a picture.
3. Take a picture itself 

Scenario 2: Start recording video
1. Get a signal from the web api when user presses the button "Start recording"
2. Send a "1" on another GPIO-pin to all the slaves 
3. Start recording itself --> Run picture program code


Slave program: all the other raspberry pis with connected cameras

Scenario 1: Take picture
1. Check both GPIO-pins constantly
2. If "1" is recieved on the picture GPIO-pin --> Run picture program code

Scenario 2: Start recording video
1. Check both GPIO-pins constantly
2. If "1" is recieved on the video GPIO-pin --> Run video program code


Implementation:

webserver: Raspbian, Nginx or Apache- with HTML, PHP and Perl support
trigger-program: Python
Recording: Python, OpenCV
